**AI Essay Detection System**

Overview
Welcome to the AI Essay Detection System! This project focuses on creating an efficient and robust system for detecting essays using advanced feature engineering methods and machine learning models. Our approach utilizes three feature engineering techniques: cosine similarity, n-grams, and bag of words. We have implemented two machine learning models: logistic regression and neural networks, achieving impressive results with both models.

Features
1. Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a similarity score.
2. N-grams: Breaks down text into n-grams (contiguous sequences of n items) to capture the context.
3. Bag of Words: Represents text by its word frequency, disregarding the order of words but considering their occurrence.

Machine Learning Models
1. Logistic Regression: A simple yet powerful linear model for binary classification.
2. Neural Networks: A complex model capable of capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

Applications
1. Plagiarism Detection: Identifies and flags instances of copied or closely paraphrased content in academic essays.
2. Automated Grading: Assists educators in grading essays by providing insights based on the content and structure.
3. Content Originality: Enhances the originality of content in online publishing platforms by detecting similarities with existing texts.
